# Let's React! A brief activity

Our goal here is to experience the role of the **render()** method, **props**, and **state** in a React component.

Do the following:
- Add literally any HTML element of your choice to the component's render method
- The component is currently receiving a string property called "imgSrc" from the `App` 
component (see line 21 of `App.js`.)
