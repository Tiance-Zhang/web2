 # Activity 6 | INFSCI 2560: Web Technologies & Standards

Now that you're a React expert, you're going to do build your own little mini-twitter. Jack Dorsey did it, and he 
[only eats one meal a day](https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-only-eats-7-meals-per-week-2020-1). So you've totally got this.

## TASKS

Start off by remixing this project. Don't forget to give it a more descriptive name (not that Glitch's random names aren't adorable).
Then do the following!

### Task 1

Some absent-minded engineer (who will go unnamed) seems to have gotten sidetracked in the middle of a task. If you look at `App.js`, you'll see that an
attribute of the `SiteBanner` component suggests that the header at the top of the page should say "The BEST Twitter". When we look at the page, however,
we see that it says "Decent Twitter". Change `site-banner.js` so that the component within honors the value passed into it by `App.js`.

### Task 2

You may have noticed that The `ViewTweet` component has some interesting bugs. 

- No matter what text you enter for each tweet, the component always just displays "View Tweet".
- We can't currently see who the author of each tweet is.
- There seems to be a Like button in this component, and the `render()` method of the component is displaying a property called `likeCount`. However, this count never
seems to increase when the button is clicked.

Your job is to fix these bugs.

### Task 3

For this task, you can choose one of several options. These vary in difficulty

## NOTES

As you've already discovered in this class, there are many ways to reach a goal in web development (which is why it's so cool!)
