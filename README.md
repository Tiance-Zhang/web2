# A ittle in-class React activity

In this project, the main `App` component contains a component called `MySpecialComponent`. We're going to
spruce it up a little.

Do the following!

- The component is being passed a string **property** called imgSrc from the `App` component. (If you want, you can see this on line 21 
of `App.js`). Change the component so that the `img` tag below has its `src` attribute set to the value of the propery.

        <li>
          Change the component so that it now <strong>renders</strong> a new HTML element that
          can contain text. A div or a p might be good.
        </li>
        <li>
          This component has a special power. Whenever you click your mouse inside it, a 
          property in the <code>state</code> of the component increases. Change the element
          you added in the previous step so that the <code>clickCount</code> property
          of the component's state gets displayed inside it.
        </li>
      </ul>
